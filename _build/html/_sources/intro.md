The world's biodiversity is threatened by multiple factors, making conservation work a challenging prospect:

🖐️ Conservation is challenging at best, exacerbated by climate change and multiple resource demands. It requires a multidisciplinary approach that taxes any organization's capacity.
🖐️ Conservation organizations rarely have the time or capacity to measure success and incorporate learning into their project implementation. Data generation, management, and analysis are increasingly important but challenging.
🖐️ Solutions for geospatial analysis, collaborative leadership, and communications are not geared toward conservation organizations.
